    <string name="about">Post-mortem organ weight data were collected from a total of 1262 decedents at the Salt River Medico-legal mortuary in Cape Town, South Africa, between 2013 and 2016.  These individuals were identified as ethnically ‘African’ (Negroid African); ‘White’ (Caucasian); or ‘Coloured’.  ‘Coloured’ refers to mixed race individuals that are genetically predominantly Khoisan, Negroid Africans, and Caucasian, with a smaller Asian contribution.   For the purposes of modelling, ethnic groups are treated as categorical variables.
\n\nOnly deaths at the scene of incident due to sharp force trauma, blunt force trauma, or gunshot wounds were considered.  The post-mortem interval before autopsy was ≤3 days and autolysed/decomposing organs were excluded.  Other exclusions were macroscopic pathological organ changes due to any incidental disease or congestion/oedema, except in the lungs where ‘posterior congestion’ was accepted.  Organ injury resulting in tissue loss or pulping/mincing of tissue also resulted in exclusion. 
The ideal organ weight ranges were derived from male and female decedents between the ages of 18 and 35 years with normal Body Mass Indices.  Each reference range was calculated as the mean ± 1.96*standard deviation.
The predicted organ weight ranges use the multiple linear regression equation developed for each organ.  They are the interval within which 95% of future individual observations should lie, taking into account the variability about the mean predicted value.
